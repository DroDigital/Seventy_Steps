# Third-party notices

This file lists third-party material only. The project's own licence is in `LICENSE`.

Seventy Steps draws its textures, sprites, meshes and synthesised sounds in code. What it ships from
others is listed here, with each licence as its authors require.

## three.js

The game's renderer, bundled into the build.

## Electron

The desktop shell. A packaged build also ships Electron's own `LICENSE` and `LICENSES.chromium.html`
(the notices of Chromium and the libraries it carries), which Electron's distribution includes; a
package must keep both beside the executable.

## Recorded sounds

The recorded sounds in `public/audio` are from Freesound, every one dedicated to the public domain
under Creative Commons 0 (CC0 1.0 Universal). No notice is required; each file is credited anyway, with
its source recording and treatment, in [`public/audio/CREDITS.md`](public/audio/CREDITS.md).

## Title theme

`public/music/subterranean-pulse.mp3`. Its author and licence are not yet recorded; they must be
before a release.

## H. P. Lovecraft

The game is after the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft and the tales he revised or wrote with others. No
text of theirs is reproduced beyond names and brief allusions.

## Controllers in the desktop shell (gamepad-node, @kmamal/sdl, SDL2)

The desktop shell reads controllers natively (round 36) with `gamepad-node` (ISC licence, Luis Montes),
over `@kmamal/sdl` (MIT licence, Konstantinos Kamaras), which ships SDL2 (zlib licence, Sam Lantinga and
the SDL contributors). A packaged build must keep their licence texts (each package's `LICENSE`, and
SDL's, in the package's `dist`) with it.
