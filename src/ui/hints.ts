/**
 * Hints for a new investigator (playtest round 1): a line at the upper left the first time each
 * thing comes up — moving, where the story leads, a fight, a wound, a failing mind, an Elder Sign, dropped Echoes, the map,
 * a level within reach, a quest, a boss (and what each asks besides striking: blind Azathoth, Cthulhu's ship, the Dunwich Horror's powder, Ghatanothoa's stone, Shub-Niggurath's roots, Yog-Sothoth's spheres, a colossus's stoop; round 25), insight, a flask of oil bought, a grab, a hallucination — then never again (remembered in this browser, not in the save).
 * Round 14: a journey taken up again from a save first says where the story had led (the lead's line).

  fight: '{light} strikes ({heavy}: a heavy blow). {block} blocks, and calls off a swing that has not landed; {parry} parries. {lock} locks on.',
  hurt: "{heal} injects West's Reagent and closes wounds. Its doses come back when you rest.",
  mind: '{item} takes a swallow of Laudanum and steadies the mind. Away from a fight it mends by itself (▲), faster by lamplight and firelight (▲▲); the Elder Signs, Echoes and your own lantern do not count.',
  sign: 'Rest at an Elder Sign with {interact}. You rise at the last one you rested at, and the creatures you killed come back.',
  echoes: 'You dropped your Echoes where you fell. Reach the spot again to take them back.',
  level: 'You carry Echoes enough for a level (▲). Rest at an Elder Sign to grow stronger, before you fall and drop them.',
  map: '{map} opens the map. Ground you have seen stays drawn on it.',
  quest: '{journal} opens the Journal, with what you have been asked to do.',
  boss: 'Watch the ground: a boss shows where its blows will land. Roll through rings and beams.',
  stoop: 'A colossus stoops after each blow of its own: its head comes down within reach, and a strike there hurts it several times over. Stand before its face. The revolver ({shoot}) aims for a head it can reach.',
  ship: "No blade finishes Cthulhu. Wound it until the Alert comes, then take her helm ({interact}) and drive her at it.",
  powder: "The Dunwich Horror cannot be seen. Near it, {interact} scatters the Powder of Ibn Ghazi, three doses, and shows it for a while. At the last no blade finishes it: chant the incantation ({interact}) near it.",
  cover: "Ghatanothoa's gaze turns flesh to stone: four seconds in its sight and you are lost, the colour draining and the picture cracking as it takes hold. Stand behind a monolith and it wears off.",
  roots: 'While the spawning roots stand, Shub-Niggurath takes only a fifth of each blow, and they bring forth its young. Cut the roots down.',
  spheres: 'The iridescent spheres are gates: touch one and you come out of the next, and now and then the whole arena leaps. Yog-Sothoth is struck where its own spheres rest.',
  blind: 'Azathoth cannot see you, and nothing you strike it with matters. It hears: running, rolling, swinging and shots carry far, walking less, and walking with {block} held or standing still not at all. Outlast the piping.',
  insight: 'Insight buys strength when you rest at an Elder Sign.',
  gun: '{shoot} fires the revolver: six rounds, and the spare ones you carry. {reload} loads it. It strikes hard up close and little from afar, and misses small things at range. Rounds lie in boxes about the dream and are sold by merchants.',
  oil: '{throw} throws a flask of lamp oil; it bursts and burns where it lands. Lock on first to throw it at a foe.',
  grab: 'A crimson flare means a grab: no guard stops it. Roll away ({dodge}).',
  unmoored: 'Unmoored: you strike weaker and are struck harder, your breath comes back slower, and the body wears away a little. Laudanum ({item}), a lamp or a fire, or rest brings the mind back.',
  phantom: 'It was never there. At the edge of madness the mind conjures horrors: they vanish when struck, and their blows wound only the mind. Laudanum ({item}) or rest steadies it.',
