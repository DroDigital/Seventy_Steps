/**
 * Journeys (playtest round 2): every long jump happens under the veil (veil.ts), so the world is
 * built out of sight — arriving in a game begun or continued, fast travel, the descent into dream,
 * a gate, waking after death. The veil covers while the world stands still; the jump is made; the
 * world takes one step without the investigator's hand (the creatures about the arrival rise), then
 * waits in the dark while the chunks about it are built at a larger budget, the veil's line filling
 * as they stand (playtest round 10); the shaders the world needs are made ready out of sight (`ready`:
 * nothing is drawn while the veil covers all), and the veil lifts, the world moving again as it does.
 * Dying, the veil falls as the investigator does, and the death throes wait for it before the respawn.
