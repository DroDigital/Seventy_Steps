/**
 * What the horrors that speak say aloud (the voices). Until now no horror spoke: they had a name, a
 * line under it and an epitaph (data/bossCards.ts, epitaphs.ts), all read. Those that speak in their
 * own stories do now, twice: a line as they arrive (the first time one meets the investigator: the
 * cutscene shows it low on the screen as it is said) and a last as they fall. Each is written as it
 * is performed, [audio tags], pauses and a leaned-on CAPITAL and all (speechNpcs.ts says how); the
 * words shown are those with the tags out and the capitals let down again (`shown`). Keyed by roster
 * id; the rest stay wordless, as their stories leave them. The two that have no scene (the Dunwich
 * Horror is unseen, Brown Jenkin joins a fight already begun, and speaks no more: his one line was given up, round 46, for a voice's place) say only a last line, shown as a notice
 * (render/cinemaDirector.ts). Data only.
