/**
 * Recorded sounds (playtest round 6): public-domain recordings (public/audio, credited in its
 * CREDITS.md), cut and treated for the game. A set is a few takes of one sound; the engine picks one
 * (never the last twice running) at a pitch within the set's range (render/audio/sampler.ts). They
 * answer game events in place of, or over, a stinger's synthesized recipe (data/sounds.ts), speak for
 * creatures in place of their voice's recipe (voices.ts), and make each region's ambience: recorded
 * beds, with spot sounds now and then, over its drone. Until a file has loaded (or without it) the
 * recipes play as before.
