/**
 * The spoken word (the voices): a line said by someone, a person at an Elder Sign or a horror, plays
 * its recording (public/voice, named by data/speech.ts `clipOf`) on the speech bus, one voice at a
 * time, the next cutting off the last, with some hall behind the great (data/speechCast.ts: a
 * playback rate that lowers a voice, an echo). A recording is fetched and decoded when its line is
 * first said, and a talk's next lines are fetched ahead; a few decoded ones are kept. A line with no
 * recording, or one that has not loaded, plays nothing: it is read, as every line was before.
