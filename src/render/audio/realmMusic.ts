/**
 * The realms' background music (round 28; data/realmMusic.ts): the track of the realm the
 * investigator is in sounds on a seamless loop (realmLoop.ts), at the music's one loudness
 * (loudness.ts), and as they cross into another realm it gives way to that realm's by a crossfade
 * of REALM_MUSIC.change seconds, equal power, so there is no gap. A track is fetched and decoded when
 * first wanted (so the realm's music is ready a moment after they arrive, the world's own ambience
 * having carried it), and the one before is let go. Under a boss's score it gives way, and returns
 * after; while the ground has gone quiet before a horror (the hush) it gives way to a murmur; and
 * its level breathes very slowly, so a loop of four minutes is not heard to turn. It joins the
 * music's bus, so the music setting is its level. A file that cannot be had is passed over
 * quietly and asked for again after a while (trackCache.ts, shared with the boss themes). Without WebAudio
 * it is silent.
